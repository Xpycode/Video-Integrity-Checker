# Resume Point

> **This file is a temporary bridge.** Delete after resuming work.

## Quick Context
<!-- 2-3 sentences max. What's the situation? -->

-

## Still In Progress
<!-- What's partially done? Include enough detail to continue. -->
-

## Decisions Made
<!-- Key choices so the next session doesn't re-debate -->
-

<!-- What's stuck? Include any workarounds tried. -->
-

<!-- THE MOST IMPORTANT SECTION. Exact next action. -->
**Immediate next step:**

## Usage

**Create this file when:**
- Session ends mid-task
- Context is getting full and you need fresh start
- Handing off to a different session

**On resume:**
1. Read this file first
2. Execute the "Start Here" action
3. **Delete this file** (it's served its purpose)

**Why delete?** Stale resume points pollute future sessions. PROJECT_STATE.md is the permanent record; this is just a cognitive bridge.
