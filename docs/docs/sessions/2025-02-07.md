## Goal
Discover and install agent skills from skills.sh to enhance Claude Code capabilities across all projects.

## Progress
- Discovered skills.sh — a marketplace for reusable AI agent capabilities
- Installed Swift/Apple skills locally, then globally:
  - `swiftui-expert-skill` (avdlee) — SwiftUI patterns, state management, Liquid Glass
  - `swift-concurrency` (avdlee) — async/await, actors, Swift 6 migration
- Installed comprehensive UI/design skill collections globally:
  - `vercel-labs/agent-skills` (4 skills) — web design, React best practices
  - `anthropics/skills` (17 skills) — frontend-design, pdf, docx, xlsx, pptx, mcp-builder
  - `nextlevelbuilder/ui-ux-pro-max` (1 skill) — 50 styles, 21 palettes, 9 tech stacks
  - `wshobson/agents` (146 skills) — architecture, testing, security, accessibility, marketing
  - `giuseppe-trisciuoglio/developer-kit` (70 skills) — shadcn-ui, React, Spring Boot, AWS
- Analyzed project needs via ANALYSIS docs to find targeted skills
- Installed workflow-aligned skills:
  - `obra/superpowers` (14 skills) — systematic-debugging, TDD, verification, planning, git-worktrees
  - `remotion-dev/skills` (1 skill) — video processing with React
  - `boristane/agent-skills` (1 skill) — logging best practices

## Summary
**261 skills** now installed globally at `~/.claude/skills/`

Key categories available:
- Swift/SwiftUI development
- UI/UX design (50+ styles, accessibility, responsive)
- Web development (React, Tailwind, shadcn)
- Workflow patterns (planning, debugging, TDD, verification)
- Document generation (PDF, DOCX, XLSX, PPTX)
- Architecture & testing patterns
- AWS/DevOps skills

## Decisions
- Install skills globally (`--global`) for availability across all projects
- Skills auto-activate based on context keywords — no manual invocation needed
- Update skills periodically with `npx skills update`

## Commands Learned
```bash
# Install
npx skills add <owner/repo> --yes --global --agent claude-code

# Manage
npx skills list --global    # List installed
npx skills check            # Check for updates
npx skills update           # Update all
npx skills find             # Discover new skills
npx skills remove X -g      # Uninstall
```

## Next
- Test skill activation in actual development sessions
- Periodically run `npx skills update` to get improvements
- Consider creating custom skills for Directions-specific patterns
