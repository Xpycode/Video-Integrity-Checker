## Goal
Research pointfreeco/sqlite-data library and identify which apps have database needs.

## Progress
- Reviewed [pointfreeco/sqlite-data](https://github.com/pointfreeco/sqlite-data) — a modern Swift persistence layer built on GRDB with SwiftData-like API (`@Table`, `@FetchAll`, `@FetchOne`), CloudKit sync, ~6x faster than GRDB+Codable
- Audited all projects across 1-macOS and 2-iOS for database usage
- Found 6 projects with persistence:
  - **MusicServer** — GRDB (best migration candidate for sqlite-data)
  - **FileManagement/Nexus** — SwiftData (ML embeddings, file indexing)
  - **CardGamesTutorials** — SwiftData (game stats, profiles)
  - **LangDisp** (iOS) — SwiftData (language cards, spaced repetition)
  - **PhotoInventory** (iOS) — SwiftData (inventory, photos, barcodes)
  - **Meeting Recording** (macOS) — Core Data (transcripts, speakers)

## Decisions
- No adoption decision yet — sqlite-data is bookmarked as a potential upgrade path, especially for MusicServer (already on GRDB) or any SwiftData project hitting pain points

## Next
- Decide if/when to try sqlite-data in a real project
- MusicServer is the most natural first candidate (already GRDB-based)
