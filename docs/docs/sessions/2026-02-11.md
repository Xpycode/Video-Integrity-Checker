# Session: 2026-02-11

## Goal
Check Directions state, deploy latest updates, and set up multi-Mac skills sync.

## Progress
- Reviewed current Directions state — 1 commit ahead of GitHub
- Pushed pending commit (skills.sh integration session log)
- Analyzed `.agents/` and `.claude/` directories:
  - `.claude/settings.local.json` — useful project permissions reference
  - `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/` — duplicates of global skills, managed externally
- Added to `.gitignore`: skills directories (managed by `npx skills`)
- Committed `settings.local.json` as reference for project setup
- Included pending cookbook update (web development patterns - Jinja2 data injection)
- Created `scripts/install-skills.sh` for multi-Mac skills deployment

## Decisions
- Keep `.claude/settings.local.json` in repo as setup reference
- Ignore `.claude/skills/` and `.agents/` — managed by skills.sh, not git
- Skills deployment via script rather than manual instructions

## Artifacts
- `scripts/install-skills.sh` — one-command skills installation

## Next
- Test install-skills.sh on second Mac
- Consider adding MCP server setup to the script
