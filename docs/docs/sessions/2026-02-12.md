## Goal
Install and configure codemoot — a multi-model CLI bridge between Claude Code and Codex CLI (GPT) for cross-model code review and debate.

## Progress
- Evaluated codemoot repo (github.com/katarmal-ram/codemoot)
- Installed prerequisites: pnpm 10.29 (globally)
- npm package was broken (workspace protocol bug) — cloned and built from source instead
- Repo cloned to `/Users/sim/Tools/codemoot`, built via `pnpm build`, linked globally via `pnpm link --global`
- Ran `codemoot init` — creates `.cowork.yml` config and `.cowork/` directory (gitignored)
- Verified `codemoot doctor` passes in both __DIRECTIONS and Penumbra projects
- Fixed Claude Code integration issue: Claude Code was interpreting "codemoot review" as the built-in `/code-review` skill
- Added codemoot section to global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` instructing Claude Code to run `codemoot` via Bash, not as a skill

## Decisions
- **Build from source over npm:** The published `@codemoot/cli` npm package has a `workspace:*` protocol bug that prevents global install. Building from source at `/Users/sim/Tools/codemoot` works reliably.
- **Global CLAUDE.md over per-project:** Added codemoot instructions to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so it works across all projects without per-project setup.

## Next
- Try `codemoot review` on actual Swift project code to evaluate quality of cross-model review
- Explore `codemoot debate` for architecture decisions
- Consider adding codemoot to the Directions workflow (e.g., before commits or during code review phase)
