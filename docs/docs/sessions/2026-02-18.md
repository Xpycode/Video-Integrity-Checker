## Goal
Evaluate and install XcodePreviews CLI tool for SwiftUI preview capture.

## Progress
- Evaluated [Iron-Ham/XcodePreviews](https://github.com/Iron-Ham/XcodePreviews) — CLI toolkit that builds and screenshots SwiftUI previews without full app builds
- Cloned repo to `/Users/sim/XcodeProjects/0-DIRECTIONS/XcodePreviews/`
- Installed Ruby `xcodeproj` gem (+ dependencies: nanaimo, colored2, claide, atomos)
- Made all scripts executable
- Installed `/preview` skill to `~/.claude/commands/preview.md`
- Set `PREVIEW_BUILD_PATH` and Ruby gem PATH in `~/.zshrc`
- Replaced `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` placeholders with concrete path in skill definition

## Decisions
- **XcodePreviews location**: Stored alongside Directions at `/Users/sim/XcodeProjects/0-DIRECTIONS/XcodePreviews/` (not inside a specific app project, since it's a shared tool)
- **Manual install over plugin marketplace**: Used manual clone + skill copy approach for full control

## Notes
- Default simulator target is "iPhone 17 Pro" — may need `--simulator` override depending on Xcode version
- Requires a booted iOS Simulator to capture screenshots
- Three build modes: standalone (5s), Xcode project dynamic injection (3-4s), SPM package (20s)
- Gives Claude Code "visual eyes" on SwiftUI views during development

## Next
- Test `/preview` on an actual SwiftUI view in a real project
- Verify simulator compatibility (iPhone 17 Pro vs available sims)
- Consider adding to the multi-Mac skills install script (`skills.sh`)
