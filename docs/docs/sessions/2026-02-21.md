## Goal
Improve Claude Code UX — make command approval prompts more informative.

## Progress
- Researched whether Claude Code has a built-in setting to show command explanations in approval prompts (it doesn't)
- Added instruction to global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` under Communication Style: "When running shell commands that require approval, always explain the command's purpose in your message before executing it"

## Decisions
- Workaround via CLAUDE.md instruction rather than waiting for a Claude Code feature — explanation appears in conversation text before the approval prompt

## Next
- Monitor if the explanation-before-approval pattern works well in practice
- Consider filing a feature request at github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues for native support
