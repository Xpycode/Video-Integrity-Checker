# Session: 2026-01-23

## Goal
Analyze and improve the Directions documentation system - identify what to add, remove, and consolidate for better UX and results.

## Context
- Previous session: Initial Directions system in place
- Current phase: Meta-improvement of the system itself

## Progress

### Completed
- [x] Full system analysis (61 files, ~10,300 lines)
- [x] Deleted 9 sync-conflict files (cruft cleanup)
- [x] Deduped commands/review.md and commands/minimums.md (-53 lines)
- [x] Simplified onboarding flow (4 options → 2, combined Steps 2+3)
- [x] Added "Setup complete!" message after first-time setup
- [x] Streamlined session start (5 files → 1 file first)
- [x] Consolidated 30_production-checklist + 33_app-minimums (cross-references, clear separation)
- [x] Created 34_testing.md (557 lines) - comprehensive testing guide
- [x] Pushed all changes to GitHub

### Discovered
- Testing was #1 gap - flagged in every code review
- Onboarding had too many decision points causing analysis paralysis
- UI/UX checklist was duplicated between 30 and 33
- Commands embedded checklists instead of pointing to source docs

### Decisions Made
- Two-part release flow: /minimums (features) → /review (code quality)
- Detection flow: Migrate or Skip (removed Merge, Separate, Ignore options)
- Session start reads only PROJECT_STATE.md first, defers others

## Remaining Gaps (Prioritized)

### High Priority
- [ ] 35_data-persistence.md - migrations, schema versioning
- [ ] 36_accessibility.md - VoiceOver, keyboard nav, WCAG
- [ ] 37_monitoring.md - structured logging, crash reporting
- [ ] 38_security.md - API auth, encryption, OWASP

### Medium Priority
- [ ] 39_ci-cd.md - GitHub Actions, automation
- [ ] Performance profiling (expand 31_debugging.md)

### Low Priority
- [ ] 45_i18n.md - localization
- [ ] 46_team-workflows.md - multi-developer patterns
- [ ] 47_api-design.md - REST patterns

## Next Session
- Write 35_data-persistence.md (data loss is catastrophic)
- Or tackle accessibility guide (legal requirement)

## Notes
Net improvement: ~170 lines removed, 557 lines added (testing guide), better UX for first-time users.
