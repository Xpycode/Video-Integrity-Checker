## Goal
Research WFGY repository for useful patterns; extract LLM failure mode taxonomy.

## Progress
- Analyzed [WFGY](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY) semantic reasoning engine (1.3k stars)
- Spawned 3 parallel agents to evaluate: SDK/core, problem map, benchmarks
- **Finding:** The 16 failure modes are genuine and useful; the implementation is mostly stubs
- **Finding:** Claims are marketing-heavy ("GPT-4 + WFGY > GPT-5" based on 80 philosophy questions)
- Created `53_llm-failure-modes.md` - extracted and adapted the failure taxonomy

## What We Got From WFGY
The failure mode taxonomy is actually valuable:
- 16 categorized failure modes (Generation, Context, Retrieval, Reasoning, Security, Deployment)
- Matches real problems in AI-assisted development
- Added practical detection patterns and mitigations

## What We Didn't Use
- The SDK (current implementation is `logits × 0.55` - a stub)
- The symbolic formulas (ΔS, BBAM/BBPF/BBCR module names)
- The benchmark claims (not reproducible)

## Decisions
- Worth extracting problem taxonomies from research projects even when implementations aren't ready
- Failure modes reference belongs in the 50s range (AI/context management docs)

## Next
- Test the failure mode detection patterns in practice
- Consider adding to quick-reference triggers
