## Goal
Install Vestige memory MCP server for Claude

## Progress
- Researched Vestige MCP from GitHub (samvallad33/vestige)
- Downloaded v1.1.1 binary for macOS ARM
- Installed to `~/.local/bin/vestige-mcp`
- Updated `~/.claude.json` with full path to binary
- Verified binary works (v1.1.1)

## Decisions
- Installed Vestige alongside existing `memory` MCP (knowledge graph)
- Two complementary memory systems: Vestige for naturalistic recall with decay, memory MCP for structured knowledge graphs

## Next
- Restart Claude Code to load the new MCP server
- Test Vestige memory tools (`store_memory`, `recall`, `forget`)
