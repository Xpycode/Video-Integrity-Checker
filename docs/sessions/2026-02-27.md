# Session: 2026-02-27

## Goal
Project housekeeping — reorganize folder structure, push to GitHub, add proper README.

## Context
- Previous session: [2026-02-26](2026-02-26.md) — MXF inspector, enhanced validation, Tier 1 gap closure
- Current phase: implementation

## Progress

### Completed
- [x] Reorganized project into numbered folder structure (01_Project, 02_Design, 03_Screenshots, 04_Exports)
- [x] Moved Xcode project, source code, and project.yml into 01_Project/
- [x] Moved IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md into docs/
- [x] Created comprehensive .gitignore (was missing entirely)
- [x] Updated CLAUDE.md project structure section
- [x] Added remote origin (https://github.com/Xpycode/Video-Analyzer)
- [x] Rebased local history onto GitHub's initial commit, resolved .gitignore conflict
- [x] Pushed full project history to GitHub
- [x] Wrote proper README.md with features, detection table, build instructions, project structure

### Decisions Made
- Removed `*PLAN*.md` from .gitignore — too aggressive, caught IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md which is a permanent doc
- Kept fastlane rules from GitHub's default .gitignore during merge conflict resolution
- README license section notes "not currently published under an open-source license"

## Next Session
- Test with real corrupt/MXF files
- Tier 2 gaps: fMP4 segments, MXF metadata depth
- Dual-engine cross-reference (AVFoundation vs ffmpeg comparison)
- Unit tests
- Regenerate xcodeproj via XcodeGen from 01_Project/ to verify paths

## Notes
- Git correctly detected all 25 file renames during the reorg (no delete+re-add)
- xcodeproj uses `sourceTree = "<group>"` with relative paths, so moving source + xcodeproj together preserves all internal references
